This is a simple bus application project, developed as part of my third internship during college. It represents my first experience working with TypeScript, and while it is not a production-ready or highly sophisticated application, I wanted to share it as a little milestone in my learning journey.

The primary goal of this project was to explore TypeScript and basic application development concepts. It should not be taken too seriously—rather, it serves as a reference point for my growth. By keeping it here, I hope to look back in the future and see how far I’ve progressed.
